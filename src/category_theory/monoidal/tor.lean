# Tor, the left-derived functor of tensor product

We define `Tor C n : C ⥤ C ⥤ C`, by left-deriving in the second factor of `(X, Y) ↦ X ⊗ Y`.

For now we have almost nothing to say about it!
It would be good to show that this is naturally isomorphic to the functor obtained
by left-deriving in the first factor, instead.

-- PROJECT showing `Tor C n ≅ Tor' C n` will require a bit more theory!
-- Possibly it's best to axiomatize delta functors, and obtain a unique characterisation?
